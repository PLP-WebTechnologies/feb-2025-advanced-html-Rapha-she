   <dt>The BLW Campus Ministry, led by Pastor Chris, is a ministry that serves tertiary institutions globally and locally at the Fort Hare University campus in East London and Alice. 
    Our mission is to impact communities, structures, and individuals, nurturing future generations poised to make a difference in the world. Our vision is to bring the divine presence of Jesus Christ to campuses and beyond, showcasing miracles and spreading His teachings through the Holy Spirit and the Word of God. We aim to empower students to realise their full potential in Christ, achieve their dreams, and engage in initiatives that enhance academic excellence and well-being through spiritual and psychological support. BLW places an emphasis on fostering leadership development through spiritual and psychological support. 
    Additionally, our organisation provides entrepreneurial education to students. Below are our core values as a ministry:</dt>
